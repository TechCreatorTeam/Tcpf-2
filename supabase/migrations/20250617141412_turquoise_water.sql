  # Fix RLS policies for secure download tokens
  
  1. Policy Updates
    - Update policies to allow proper token creation during checkout
    - Allow public access for token creation (needed during checkout process)
    - Maintain security while enabling functionality
  
  2. Security
    - Keep read access restricted to active, non-expired tokens
    - Allow token creation for checkout process
    - Maintain audit trail access controls
