- **Email Verification**: Each link is tied to the customer's email address

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Email Service (Brevo)
VITE_BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
```
